# IST-303-Team-B-Project: Cuisine 'n COVID19
***
## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
In this project you are required to implement a GUI application in Python 3. The GUI app interfaces the user to an underlying data store. The project should be completed using the agile principles articulated in Pilone & Miles. Make sure to meet with your instructor as regularly as you require to ensure that the project is scoped appropriately – neither too narrowly nor too widely.

### Product: Cuisine 'n COVID19
Orange County Restaurant COVID19-compliant
Restaurants map in Orange County in COVID19 situation

**Concept:** A website that allows you to look for restaurants currently open during the pandemic, what services are being provided, and how they are enforcing COVID regulations. We will filter out information from Twitter and Yelp posts and reviews to obtain information that is most relevant to our website's goal. We will create the necessary map using GIS, and create a program that points to a given location within that map using queries to extract information from Twitter using Twitter's API.

### Research:

[![N|Solid](https://i.ibb.co/xF6pQzb/SafeDine.png)](https://www.ocbc.org/safedineoc-grantrecipient/)

The County of Orange announced on August,6 2020 that the launch of a new SafeDineOC COVID-Safe Restaurant Campaign to incentivize Orange County restaurants to follow California Department of Public Health (CDPH) guidance to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Restaurant owners may apply for a $1,000 grant per Orange County restaurant location for taking steps to create a COVID-safe environment for their customers and employees. The grant will reimburse restaurants for purchases of personal protective equipment including face masks, cleaning products, employee training and costs for physical distancing of tables and chairs, as examples.

The SafeDineOC campaign is sponsored by the County of Orange and managed by Orange County Business Council (OCBC), which will handle intake and approval of all restaurant applications as well as disbursement of the $1,000 grants to restaurant owners. Through its comprehensive database of restaurants, the OC Health Care Agency will ensure the promotion of the campaign to all restaurant owners in the County.

Restaurants that apply and are approved will be added to a list of COVID-safe eateries organized by city that will be available to consumers on the SafeDineOC website. This online resource will enable the public to see which restaurants offer a safe dining experience in Orange County

“Maintaining consumer confidence in the restaurant industry is critical to helping businesses stay afloat during these challenging times,” said Supervisor Lisa Bartlett. “When customers visit a restaurant, they want to be confident that it is clean and in compliance with County health and safety guidelines,” said Bartlett. “The safety and protection of restaurant workers, and the customers they serve, is paramount to stopping the spread of COVID-19,” she said.

Finally, the OCBC (Orange County Business Council) launched the list the forefront of safely serving Orange County at https://www.ocbc.org/safedineoc-grantrecipient/

The Orange Health Care Agency has published the list of restaurants which has been joined the food inspection campaign. The list is contained upto 13,000 restaurants across the county. Our group extract the list which includes restaurants'name and address.
After finished extracting database manually, we examed and cleaned up data to select only restaurants.

 
### Process:
Timeline: 
* Creating map of restaurants in given area(s)
* Creating program to point to map given certain criteria
* Testing programming, fixing bugs

### Velocity
### * Milestone 1
There are 3 user stories and 6 Tasks in Milestone 1

| Task No. | Task | Days required | Hours required |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **U7** | **I would like to see a login page.** | **4**| **
| 7a | Create landing page with GUI interface using Flask. | 2 | 8
| 7b | Create interactive username and password text fields. | 2 | 8
| **U8** | **I would like to see a map of restaurants within Orange County.** | **6** | **
| 8a | Embed arcgis web-map of Orange County, display all restaurants as pins on map. | 3 | 12
| 8b | Create boundary for Orange county using arcpy code, drawing polygon on top of map. | 3 | 12
| **U9** | **I want to be able to access my account and save my searches and preferences.** | **9** | **
| 9a | Create user profile page -- which shows user's preferences and searches. | 5 | 20
| 9b | Create a user account list, data storage location which allows diners to find people they know. | 4 | 16
| | Total | 19 | 76 (19x4)

Days needed = 19 days | Assume that 4 working hours per day | 4 developers --> 1 hour per team member per day

It is complicated to calculate base on task completed, then we calculate base on sum of working hours used vs number of day left.
We have calculated the velocity as below:

| Factors | Data | How to calculate |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Sprint start date | 7-Oct | |
| Sprint end date | 2-Nov |  |
| Working days | 19 |  |
| Team size | 4 |  |
| Work hours per day | 1 |  |
| Total available hours | 76 | working days * team size * work hours per day |
| Average daily available hours | 4 | total available hours / working days |
| Average productivity | 80 % |  |
| Productivity hours | 60.8 | total available hours * average productivity |
| Average daily productive hours | 3.2 | productivity hours / working days |


### Burn Down Chart:
We have created the burn down calculator to input the working hours for each developer.
Please follow the link https://bit.ly/31q50o7
(Only CGU member with this link can access, but only our team can edit)

[![N|Solid](https://i.ibb.co/BCcyRhM/GraphJ.png)](https://bit.ly/31q50o7)

**What burndown chart did told us about the team's situation?**
Because we calculate the burndown chart as (Working day left: X) and (Expected working hours burned left: Y)
* We worked under the expected working hours every day (we targeted everyone works an hour per day)
* Especially, in the middle of M1, the midterm exam and pair exercises took almost working hours.
* However, we accelerated to complete our M1 and able to complete it as promised.
* The last 8 days, we burned working hours more than target at 6 hours per day averagely.
* The chart warned us in the middle of M1 that we needed to accelerated and worked more to acheive the target.

### Functional and Test Code:
* Test load URL index
* Test load URL dashboard
* Test login
* Test signup

The proposed testing code:
```sh
from flask import Flask
import json
from project.Cuisine import User,LoginForm,RegisterForm

#load URL index
def test_base():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    # configure_routes(app)
    # client = app.test_client()
    ## --- Fix URL test download ----
    # url = '/'

    # response = client.get(url)

    # assert response.status_code == 200

#load URL dashboard
def test_base_dashboard():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    configure_routes(app)
    # client = app.test_client()
    # url = '/dashboard'

    # response = client.get(url)
    # assert response.status_code == 200

def test_login(app):
    with app.test_client() as c:
        c.post('/login', follow_redirects=True, dict(
            name=username,
            password=test_password
        ))
    assert flask.session['user_id'] == user_id

def test_signup(app):
    with app.test_client() as c:
        c.post('/signup', follow_redirects=True, dict(
            username="",
            email="",
            password=""
        ))

```

```
4) Copy URL (http://127.0.0.1:5000) and paste into web browser


### The lesson learned from M1
* Since we have limited time to deliver M1, then we need to prioritize the user stories, break down the tasks and sub-tasks and distribute to team members. Then, we can focus on each task. We have tried to set up a standup meeting to brainstorm, update progression, and solve the problems.
* Calculating velocity and burn down chart: Since we have been fixed at 4 headcounts, we have adapted the sum of hours left VS sum of hours needed to calculate velocity and create burn down chart instead of the number of tasks left.
* Testing with pytest will help us to gain confidence in our software.
* Working in difference environments or systems settings, may makes some challenges such as running application, package installation.

Days needed = 23 days | Assume that 4 working hours per day | 4 developers --> 1 hour per team member per day
Velocity = Average Productivity = 80%
When comparing to the first version of user stories from the M1, we have adapt the days required due to the decreasing of the working days of M2.

| Factors | Data | How to calculate |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Sprint start date | 4-Nov | |
| Sprint end date | 5-Dec |  |
| Working days | 23 |  |
| Team size | 4 |  |
| Work hours per day | 1 |  |
| Total available hours | 92 | working days * team size * work hours per day |
| Average daily available hours | 4 | total available hours / working days |
| Average productivity | 80 % |  |
| Productivity hours | 73.6 | total available hours * average productivity |
| Average daily productive hours | 4 | productivity hours / working days |

### Burn Down Chart:
We have created the burn down calculator to input the working hours for each developer.
Please follow the link https://bit.ly/31q50o7
(Only CGU member with this link can access, but only our team can edit)

![N|Solid](https://i.ibb.co/S0Ph0FZ/Burndown-M2.png)

**What burndown chart did told us about the team's situation?**
Because we have learned from M1, so we adapted the methodology of burndown calculating. We calculated the burndown chart as (Days of sprint: X) and (Expected productivity hours burned left: Y)
* At the beginning of M2, we can acheive the productivity hours per day as expected because we have learned a lot from M1 and we realized more clear about how we can proceed in the next step.
* Although, TDD can provide the benefits when we develop software, but we are the 'rookie' in software development, then, we went through 'dev first, test and solve later' 
* The 'target' has been calculated base on velocity = 1.0, while 'forecast' has been calculated base on velocity = 0.8. The reason that why our group burned working hours more than expected.

100% Coverage.

Testing coverage 100%
* Test base
* Test register page
* Test login page
* Test my preference
* Test login

### The lesson learned from M2
* Calculating velocity and burn down chart: Base on the M1, we have succeeded in using the proportion between the actual working hours burned and the expected hour burned. However, the M2 is different from the M1, which we need to wait for the response from the third-party who can provide permission to their services. Then, in the first half of M2, the actual working hour burned was lower than the forecast.
 * This methodology can only use base on the assumptions: 
    1) All user stories have to be achieved at the end of the iteration
    2) All estimations have been forecasted precisely
* Testing with pytest will help us to gain confidence in our software.
* Working in different environments or systems settings may make some challenges such as running applications and package installation.
* If the software need to connect to the third-party, we need to create plan B in case of unexpected situations that can cause a project delay.
